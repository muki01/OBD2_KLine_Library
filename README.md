# OBD2 KLine Library

This is Arduino library for communicating with vehicles over the **OBD2 K-Line** interface, using **ISO 9141** and **ISO 14230 (KWP2000)** protocols.

It allows you to connect your Arduino and ESP boards to your car's ECU (Engine Control Unit) and read diagnostic data like DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes), live sensor data, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏èSchematics for communication
#### This is the schematic with Transistors

The **R6** resistor in this schematic is designed for **3.3V** microcontrollers. If you are using a **5V** microcontroller, you need to change the **R6** value to **5.3kŒ©**.

Additionally, I have observed that many test devices use a **1kŒ©** value for **R4**. However, according to the K-Line documentation, the recommended value for **R4** is **510Œ©**. It is advisable to follow this value. That being said, using **1kŒ©** for **R4** will not cause any issues in the circuit. However, if you prefer to adhere to the documentation, **510Œ©** is the recommended value.
