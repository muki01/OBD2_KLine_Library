# OBD2 KLine Library

This is Arduino library for communicating with vehicles over the **OBD2 K-Line** interface, using **ISO 9141** and **ISO 14230 (KWP2000)** protocols.

It allows you to connect your Arduino and ESP boards to your car's ECU (Engine Control Unit) and read diagnostic data like DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes), live sensor data, and more.
